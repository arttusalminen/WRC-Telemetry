# WRC Telemetry App

This app is a telemetry app for EA WRC game. It reads the input telemetry data from the game and displays it in an 
overlay. 

There is also a very rudamentary delta time overlay that is displayed top middle of the screen. The app records and 
saves the stages driven, so that the delta time can be calculated from the best time driven on given stage in given 
car class. The PB runs are saved in a file called BestRuns.txt.

## How to use
1. Copy & paste the contents of "wrc config files" to the game's telemetry config folder: WRC\telemetry
2. Run the app via command line or IDE or smth 
3. Start the game


## What it looks like
